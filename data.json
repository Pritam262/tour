	"description": "Mizoram is a state in Northeast India, with Aizawl as its seat of government and capital city. The name of the state is derived from  Mizo , the self-described name of the native inhabitants, and Ram , which in the Mizo language means ' land.

The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory. In 1986 the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state. According to a 2011 census, in that year Mizoram's population was 1,091,014. It is the 2nd least populous state in the country. Mizoram covers an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres, of which approximately 91% is forested.",
